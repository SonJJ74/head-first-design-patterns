# Factory Method Pattern
The factory method pattern defines an inteface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to the subclasses.

# Abstract Factory Pattern
The abstract factory pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects 
without specifiying their concrete classes.

## OO Principles
- Depend on abstractions.  Do not depend on concrete classes.
