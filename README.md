# Design Patterns

## Strategy Pattern
The strategy patterns defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable.  
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

## Obverver Pattern
The observer pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so taht when one object change state,
all its dependents are notified and updated.
